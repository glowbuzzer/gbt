# Glowbuzzer Tools

This repository contains the Glowbuzzer Tools source code.

These tools are helpful utilities designed primarily for people involved in developing machine and robot controls but also are applicable for 3D graphics developers, games developers, etc.

The list of tools included:
* **3D rotation converter** - convert between and visualise the different 3D rotation formats: Quaternions, Euler angles, Rotation matrices, Axis-angle etc.
* **DH parameter visualiser** - visualise the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for arbitrary kinematics chains containing revolute, prismatic or fixed links and explore their kinematics.

For more information on our core product, the web-stack machine control, go to [glowbuzzer.com](https://www.glowbuzzer.com).
